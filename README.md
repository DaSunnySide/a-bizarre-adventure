0.1.2
Fixed:
  -Most routes are now complete (pending additional content)
  -scroller now moves to top of new image on click
  -casing on .jpg files corrected, so images now render properly in browser
  -images now display in Chrome
  -buttons now render properly throughout the routes
  -page names are now more accurate
  -CSS not as wonky
Known Issues:
  -High latency-May resolve by decreasing picture size, but that's still up in the air because I don't want to lose the   high photo quality
  -Like Button doesn't currently do anything

To Do:
  -User page needs a custom photo gallery-current plan is to enable like button on login, and then store liked images to a user specific array. The page then parses through the array and displays all content on screen. Potentially add an option to modify precedence of pictures to make most popular pictures float to top of the screen
